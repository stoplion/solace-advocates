- Updated NextJS to the latest version. Noticed this is the version that has the middleware vulnerability. (https://github.com/stoplion/solace-advocates/pull/1)
- Resolve hydration errors issues in frontend / backend. Get all the code pushed to repo (https://github.com/stoplion/solace-advocates/pull/2)
- Split the search into individual words (["john", "doe"]) to make the search better (https://github.com/stoplion/solace-advocates/pull/3)

- Get some super basic styles (no colors atm, just structural / UX improvements) to make presentation a tad better. Nothing fancy, just reorganizing the presentation slightly.

- A little more polish to frontend and some small performance tweaks via debouncing, async error handling, and logs removed
